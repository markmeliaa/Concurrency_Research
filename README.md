# Concurrency Research
The pdf of the research can be found in my portfolio web page, and in this Unity project you can find a maze that uses a pathfinding algorithm (A*) with concurrency applied using threads.

You can check how using concurrency, or not using it at all, affects the performance with the different capsules that are in the maze.
